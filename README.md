## Description 

This project was assigned to me to create a day planner/scheduler to help view the events that are scheduled for the day. The planner utilizes bootstrap to help simplify development and styling, as well as JavaScrip to add functionality.

## Usage 

This page is to be used to track your schedule for the current day. Past hours will be one color (red), the current hour will have a second color (grey), and the future hours will be a third color (green).

## Learning Points 

Throughout the development of this program I was able to develop my JavaScript, JQuery and bootstrap skills including (but not limited to): functions, bootstrap HTML to make it easier to apply CSS styling, transversing a website by use of the DOM, localStorage, DayJS() and more.

## Credits

 I would like to thank Henry Weigand and Kyle Vance for leading pseudocode sessions, as well as some of my classmates (including but not limited to), Thomas Munzar, Sonam Sherpa who asked great questions during the pseudocoding sessions to help increase understanding. All code was entered by myself, except for the source code provided by UC Berkely Full Stack Development Course. The source code was entered on commit "925c6c1". I also utilized the sites above to help gain a stronger understanding of concepts and how to use proper syntax, but all code was entered by myself.
